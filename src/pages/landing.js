      <h1>Hello! Welcome to the Taylor Swift Bracelet helper</h1>
      <h2>I made this website to help you make bracelets for the taylor swift eras tour!</h2>
      <h2>
        In this website you can save the letters you have and it will give you examples of quotes to
        use on your bracelets, you can add your own quote ideas and even change the number of
        letters you have in case, like me, you drop one :).
